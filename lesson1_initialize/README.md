# Lession 1: Basics
## Goal
In this lession you will learn how to
* integrate the MTI lib into your project
* start MapTrip by an intent
* initialize the MTI lib

## Overview
Like every lesson of this tutorial, this lesson is a module within Android Studio.
If you have not done so already, you should clone the complete Tutorial project now.

The individual learning steps are described in the PDF which is stored under folder 'content'.

## Note
**When you start the app for the first time, you will see an empty screen. This is okay because with this lesson your task is creating a button which starts the MapTrip app and initializes the communication with MapTrip.**
