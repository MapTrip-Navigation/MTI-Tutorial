# Navigation with MapTrip Interface API for Android - Tutorial
## About MapTrip
MapTrip is a professional GPS navigation solution for industrial requirements. 

MapTrip provides different interfaces e.g. for truck navigation, waste management or fire departments.
And it can be integrated into simple or complex custom applications by interfaces (controlling with apps), a development kit (SDK) and remote APIs.

## About MTI
MTI is the acronym for MapTrip Interface. MTI is a simple to use interface which enables developers to control the MapTrip navigation app with less commands and few requirements for development.

## About this tutorial
This tutorial shows how to use the MapTrip Interface API (MTI) to control the MapTrip navigation app with your Android App.
Step by step you will learn more about the communication between your App and MapTrip and the mechanism of MTI Callbacks.

## Usage of this tutorial
This tutorial consists of different lessons. With every lesson you will build a simple App which interacts together with MapTrip.
As is usual in tutorials, the first lesson starts with the simple basics and the following lessons become slightly more complex. Each lesson builds on the previous one. 
Accordingly, we recommend that you follow the given sequence. To keep this simple every lesson has a ordinal in its name.

## The project structure
The tutorial is created and tested with Android Studio. Surely it is possible to follow the lessons using another development environment. Of course this depends to your experience.
Anyway all explanations are related to Android Studio - we hope you are fine with this.

In Android Studio the lessons are modules so you have all lessons at a glance and can concentrate on one of them at the same time.
Switching the project view between 'Android' and 'Project Files' helps to see only the code or all other related files like documentation.

Brief overview to the tutorial structure
* every lesson is an Android Studio module and can be generated as a runnable app
* every module has its own README file with a short explanation of the lesson goal
* in every lesson module there is a folder content which contains
 * a PDF file with instructions
 * code or configuration files (for controlling if something went wrong during your own implementation steps)

## Prerequisites
Like mentioned before this tutorial describes how to control the navigation app MapTrip. So MapTrip has to be installed before.
Please ensure that MapTrip runs at your device (or an emulation within your development environment). Otherwise it is hard to understand the lessons content.
